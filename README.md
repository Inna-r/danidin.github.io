# Police Light Challenge

Hi, welcome to my Police Light Challenge.

Here is the checklist for the challenge:  

1. Create your own Github account (if you don't already have one).
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository.
3. Turn your fork into a [Github Page](https://pages.github.com/), using your username. 
4. Make it work as a police light (blue turns to red and vice versa, every X milliseconds)
5. Send me the link to the page.
